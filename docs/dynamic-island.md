# Dynamic island media and microphone

The idle island expands downwards on hover (upwards for a bottom island), showing
artwork, title, artist, transport controls and elapsed/total time. Notifications appear below the media card and never reset its hover state. Seeking is disabled for live streams and players without seek
support. Controls use the selected MPRIS player; its permanent badge in the compact row opens player selection; right-clicking the title does too.

Enable in `~/.config/yozakura/config/notch.json`:

```json
{
    "disableHoverExpansion": false,
    "hoverExpandDelay": 90,
    "hoverCollapseDelay": 200,
    "expandedMediaWidth": 440,
    "mediaAnimationDuration": 160,
    "expandedArtworkSize": 64,
    "microphoneNoticeDuration": 1800,
    "visualizer": true
}
```

Times are milliseconds, dimensions logical pixels. Existing theme colors,
roundness and animation duration apply; zero animation duration disables motion.

Add this entry to `custom` in `~/.config/yozakura/binds.json` (or configure the
same command in the keybinding editor):

```json
{
    "name": "Toggle Microphone",
    "enabled": true,
    "keys": [{"key": "M", "modifiers": ["SUPER", "ALT"]}],
    "actions": [{
        "id": "command.run",
        "args": {"command": "wpctl set-mute @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SOURCE@ toggle"},
        "layouts": []
    }]
}
```

Mute state comes from PipeWire, including external changes. A muted microphone
has a persistent icon on all idle islands. Actual mute transitions reveal an
auto-hidden island on the focused monitor where the fullscreen policy permits. Initial discovery,
volume adjustments and missing devices do not trigger messages. This controls
the default system input, not individual applications' internal mute buttons.

## Audio visualizer

With `"visualizer": true` (Settings → Shell → Notch → Audio Visualizer) the
island shows a cava spectrum: five mini bars beside the track title while
collapsed, and a wider spectrum beside the track info in the expanded card.
Bars use a `primary` → `tertiary` gradient from the current palette and only
change their own height inside a fixed slot, so the island never resizes.
Requires `cava` (PipeWire input) and hover expansion enabled.

A single shared `cava` process (`CavaService`) runs only while a visualizer is
on screen and the active player is playing; it stops 1.5 s after the last
one disappears (paused, island hidden, launcher open, toggle off). If `cava`
is missing the visualizer hides itself.

Run `node --test tests/*.test.cjs`, `python tests/hover-expansion.test.py`, and `python tests/qml-components.test.py` (PySide6 required for offscreen QML checks).
Verify on Wayland: hover/leave, seek and transport, missing artwork, no player,
notifications alongside music, fullscreen policy and microphone hotkey/external mute.

Mute-only transitions no longer open the separate bottom microphone OSD. Actual microphone volume adjustments still do.

Media morph duration is capped by the global animation duration; launcher navigation keeps the global duration. The player badge stays in place and only changes opacity on hover.

Microphone feedback uses only the animated glyph, preserving island height. The mute glyph slides in and out with the capsule width; it reserves no space while unmuted. Outgoing media remains clipped by the animated capsule until closing completes.

The title capsule and expanded card share a clipped, blurred album backdrop. Transport icons and the wavy timeline follow the existing shell theme.

On media expansion, the title backdrop fades into the system surface while the album backdrop is revealed in the card; both follow the same media morph duration.
